      <p class="w3-justify"  style="font-size:20px">The Smart Locker is a improvement for the traditional locker where we are trying to provide the lockers for public usage.
        Normal traditional lockers were used privately but as a team we think if lockers can be provided in a public way where citizens will 
        book lockers for their access in public places it would be a market opportunity.
        We are as a team will develop a locker with digital improvements where users can unlock the locker by purchasing it online for a certain time period.
        The Lock itself will be developed by a arduino based electronic system where set of lockers will be monitered by a centeralized system.

      <br><h4 class="w3-wide">Motivation</h4> <br><br>
      <p class="w3-justify"  style="font-size:20px">
        People from remote areas travel a long distance to the town in their day-to-day life. Employees come for their jobs. 
        Students come for educational purposes such as schools and tuition classes. All these times they carry a lot of things here and there 
        because they have to carry everything that they need in one go. So as a team we understand it is very difficult for those people. 
        Then we came up with the idea of public lockers for making their day-to-day life easy. 
        As a result we also understand that there are many people who can benefit from our solution rather than people who live in remote areas. This led to finalizing our idea as well.

        This system consists of three main segments. The first one is the Locker. Others are
         backend and frontend which is also known as the mobile application. Smart locker includes four main parts. 
         There are two input devices and they are Keypad and Ultrasonic sensor. There are two output devices and 
         they are LCD display and solenoid lock. The keypad is used to enter tokens and other data. The 
         Ultrasonic Sensor, helps the user to detect locker is empty or not. Through LCD display user can observe 
         messages from the locker and the token which is entred. 
        Initially, general information of lockers is stored in the cloud server database and it provides data to 
        the mobile application and lockers. Also, it collects user data through the mobile application and the Locker. Users 
        can ask about lockers and it gives details such as availability etc. If the user books a locker, then the 
        backend generates a new token and sends it to the locker and user. The main functionalities of the locker 
        are handled by the microcontroller and it makes a connection to the server through a Wi-Fi network. In 
        advance, as a security feature buzzer is used. Finally, to enhance user experiance two LEDs are used for 
        correctly identify whether the lock is in locked mode or not.

      1.NodeMCU
        <br><br>
      Used as the main micro controller and the processing unit of the hardware system.
      And a ESP8266 IC is integrated into this Micro controller.
      This can be used to connect to internet using Wi-Fi when programmed to do so. 
      Power Supply is provided to the Node MCU Using a 5-volt 2-ampere power regulator (power pack).
      The positive terminal is connected to the Vin pin of the Micro controller while the ground of the power pack is connected to a ground pin of the NodeMCU. 
      <br>The D1, D2 pins are connected to SDL and SCL of the I2C expander.
      These pins are predetermined by the NodeMCU and the SCL of the expander is always connected to the D1 pin of the NodeMCU. 
      and SDL pin is always connected to the D2 pin of the NodeMCU. 
      <br>
      A0 is connected to the door sensor.
      When the door is opened there will be an analog signal which will send into the NodeMCU.
      That signal is processed by the NodeMCU and two LEDs (Green and Red) which are connected to the D3, D4 pins of the NodeMCU will be lighted accordingly. 
      <br>
      D5, D6 Echo and Trigger pins of the Ultra Sonic Sensor the D5 pin is connected to the Trig of the Ultrasonic Sensor
      while D6 is connected to Echo Pin of the Ultrasonic Sensor. 
      <br>
      D7 is connected to the 5v 1channel relay in pin.
      The negative logic will switch the relay into normally open port of the relay.

      <p class="w3-justify"  style="font-size:18px">
        2. 5V 1Channel relay 
          <br><br>
          The D7 pin in the NodeMCU is connected to the “IN” pin of the relay.
          The power is given by 3.3v pin on the NodeMCU while ground is connected to a ground pin or ground of the 5v input that is given to the system. 
          <br>
          The 12v power supply of the power pack is connected to the common of the relay
          and the positive terminal of the solenoid lock is connected to the normally closed terminal of the relay.
           The solenoid lock is connected to the normally closed terminal because then in most of the time the lock is closed by current is running through it therefore it will not get heated up.

        <p class="w3-justify"  style="font-size:18px">
          3. Solenoid Lock 
            <br><br>
             The solenoid lock is used to open and close the locker. 
             When a current is not provided it in the closed condition therefore the locker is locked. 
             When we provide a current to the solenoid lock it will open up therefore the locker is also opened. 
             The locker is connected to the normally closed terminal of the relay. 
             Therefore, when a signal is received via “mqqt” the d7 pin will send a signal therefore the locker will open up. 
            <br>
            A 12v power pack is used to power up the solenoid lock. 
            therefore the positive terminal of the 12v is connected to the common of the relay
             while the negative terminal of the solenoid is connected to the negative of the power pack.

              The power supply to the keyboard is provided via the I/O expander. 
              The power for the I/O expander is given through the 5v power pack.

                It will show the group number and the locker number and the availability of the locker, 
                once someone rents out the locker then the availability is set to zero. 
                <br>
                When someone is inserting the password, 
                it is displayed on the display and if the password is correct, 
                it will display “the password is correct” and if not, it will display the “password is incorrect”.

                  By using this signal the customer will surely know that there is an object inside the locker. 
                  <br>
